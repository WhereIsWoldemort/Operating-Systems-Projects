> implement cd (ALMOST THERE)  
    > checks if the file being changed to exists in the current directory (COMPLETED)
    > checks if the file being changed to is a directory (COMPLETED)
    > changes the current byte address to that location (COMPLETED)
        > grabs the byte address of the directory entry for that directory (COMPLETED)
        > converts the first cluster number of that directory into a byte address (COMPLETED)
    > implement moving to "." and ".." (ALMOST THERE)
        > handle moving back to the root directory ( )
> implement ls   ( )
    > prints all file names in the current directory (COMPLETED)
    > skips over prints deleted files and volume labels (COMPLETED)
    > print "." and ".." if we are not in the root directory (COMPLETED)
    > prints all files in a contained directory (COMPLETED)
    > prints all files in a parent directory ( )
> implement stat ( )
    > prints out file name        (COMPLETED)
    > prints out file attributes  (COMPLETED)
    > prints out file size        (COMPLETED)
    > checks if the inputted file name exists in current directory (COMPLETED)
    > prints an error message if the file doesn't exist (COMPLETED)
> implement read (COMPLETED)
    > checks to see if the file exists in the current directory (COMPLETED)
    > prints an error if the file doesn't exist (COMPLETED)
    > prints an error if the file being read is a directory (COMPLETED)
    > prints a range of bytes to the user (COMPLETED) 
> implement info (COMPLETED)
    > prints bytes per sector (COMPLETED)
    > prints sectors per cluster (COMPLETED)
    > prints reserved sector count (COMPLETED)
    > prints number of FATs (COMPLETED)
    > prints size of FATs (COMPLETED)
> implement volume (COMPELTED)
    > finds the volume label for the file system image (COMPLETED)
    > if there is not volume label, it prints an error ( )
> implement checkFileExists() (COMPLETED)
    > loops through all bytes, sectors, and clusters, associated with the current directory (COMPLETED!)
    > compares inputted file name with all valid directory entries (COMPLETED)
    > when comparing, it skips over... (COMPLETED)
        > volume labels (COMPLETED )
        > empty directory entries (COMPLETED)
        > long name entries (COMPLETED)
    > halts at the end of the directory (COMPLETED)
