> Instructions to run and compile
    1. cd into directory containing all files listed above
    2. run the command "gcc -o fat32_reader fat32_reader.c boot_sector.c directory_entries.c equations.c fat_entries.c" to compile
    3. run the program by typing "./fat_reader"
	* ALTERNATIVELY, you can run the "run_and_compile.sh" shell script by entering "./run_and_compile"
> Challenges
    > Making sure we had the right results made this project tricky. We handles this by having lots of testing and figuring out what our expected results should be.
